### Noise and Noise Pollution

**Definition of Noise:**
Noise is any unwanted or disturbing sound that interferes with normal activities such as sleeping, conversation, or disrupts one's quality of life.

**Effect of Noise Pollution:**
Noise pollution can have various harmful effects on both human health and the environment. These effects include:
- **Hearing loss:** Prolonged exposure to high levels of noise can cause permanent hearing damage.
- **Stress and Mental Health:** Noise pollution can increase stress levels, cause anxiety, and contribute to mental health issues.
- **Cardiovascular Issues:** Exposure to noise pollution is linked to high blood pressure, heart disease, and stroke.
- **Sleep Disturbance:** Noise can interfere with sleep, leading to sleep deprivation and associated health problems.
- **Reduced Productivity:** Persistent noise can reduce concentration and productivity in workplaces and educational settings.

**Noise Classification:**
- **Transport Noise:** Noise from vehicles, airplanes, trains, and ships. This is often the most pervasive type of noise pollution in urban areas.
- **Occupational Noise:** Noise in the workplace from machinery, equipment, and other sources, which can be hazardous to workers' hearing and health.
- **Neighbourhood Noise:** Noise from residential areas, such as loud music, barking dogs, and lawn mowers. It also includes noise from nearby businesses and social events.

### Noise Measurement and Control

**Definition of Noise Frequency:**
Noise frequency refers to the number of sound wave cycles per second, measured in Hertz (Hz). Different frequencies are perceived as different pitches.

**Definition of Noise Pressure:**
Noise pressure is the force of sound on a surface area, measured in Pascals (Pa). It reflects the physical intensity of the sound wave.

**Definition of Noise Intensity:**
Noise intensity refers to the power carried by sound waves per unit area, measured in watts per square meter (W/mÂ²). It is a measure of the energy of the sound.

**Definition of Noise Threshold Limit Value (TLV):**
The TLV is the maximum level of noise to which a person can be exposed without risking significant health effects. It is often set by occupational safety regulations and varies depending on exposure duration.

**Definition of Equivalent Noise Level (Leq):**
Leq is a measure of the continuous equivalent sound level over a specified period. It represents the average sound level in terms of energy.

**L10 (18hr Index):**
The L10 (18hr) index is the noise level exceeded for 10% of the time over an 18-hour period. It is commonly used in assessing traffic noise exposure.

**Ld:**
Ld (daytime noise level) is the average noise level over a specific daytime period, usually from 7 AM to 10 PM, and is used to evaluate the impact of noise on daily activities.

### Noise Pollution Control

Noise pollution control involves strategies and measures to reduce the amount and impact of unwanted sound. These can include:
- **Regulations and Legislation:** Establishing legal limits for noise levels in different environments (e.g., residential, industrial).
- **Urban Planning:** Designing cities to minimize noise pollution, such as zoning laws and green spaces.
- **Soundproofing:** Using materials and structures to block or absorb noise, such as double-glazed windows and sound barriers.
- **Public Awareness:** Educating the public about the effects of noise pollution and ways to reduce noise in daily activities.
- **Technological Solutions:** Developing and implementing quieter machinery and transportation systems.

By understanding and implementing these measures, communities can mitigate the adverse effects of noise pollution and improve overall quality of life.
