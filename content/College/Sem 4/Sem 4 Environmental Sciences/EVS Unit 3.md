### Atmospheric Composition
1. **Troposphere**: 
   - Lowest layer, extends up to 8-15 km.
   - Weather phenomena occur here.
   - Temperature decreases with altitude.

2. **Stratosphere**:
   - Above troposphere, extends from 15 to 50 km.
   - Contains the ozone layer.
   - Temperature increases with altitude due to ozone absorption of UV radiation.

3. **Mesosphere**:
   - Above stratosphere, extends from 50 to 85 km.
   - Meteors burn up in this layer.
   - Temperature decreases with altitude.

4. **Thermosphere**:
   - Above mesosphere, extends from 85 to 600 km.
   - Temperature increases significantly with altitude.
   - Contains ionosphere, important for radio communication.

5. **Tropopause**:
   - Boundary between troposphere and stratosphere.
   - Characterized by a temperature inversion.

6. **Mesopause**:
   - Boundary between mesosphere and thermosphere.
   - Coldest point in Earth's atmosphere.

### Energy Balance
1. **Conductive Heat Transfer**: 
   - Transfer of heat through a medium without the movement of the medium.
   
2. **Convective Heat Transfer**: 
   - Transfer of heat by the movement of fluids (liquids or gases).
   
3. **Radiation Heat Transfer**: 
   - Transfer of heat in the form of electromagnetic waves.
   
4. **Simple Global Temperature Model**:
   - **Earth as a Black Body**: Assumes Earth absorbs all incident radiation and re-emits energy as a perfect emitter.
   - **Earth as Albedo**: Reflectivity of Earth's surface; Albedo affects the amount of solar energy absorbed.

### Greenhouse Effects
1. **Definition**: 
   - Warming of Earth's surface due to trapping of heat by greenhouse gases.
   
2. **Impact on Global Climate**:
   - Rising sea levels, altered weather patterns, impact on agriculture and marine ecosystems.
   
3. **Global Warming**:
   - Increase in Earth's average temperature due to elevated levels of greenhouse gases.
   - Consequences include extreme weather events, melting ice caps, and habitat loss.
   
4. **Control of Global Warming**:
   - Reducing greenhouse gas emissions, using renewable energy, enhancing energy efficiency.
   
5. **Earthâ€™s Heat Budget**:
   - Balance between incoming solar radiation and outgoing terrestrial radiation.

### Lapse Rate
1. **Ambient Lapse Rate**:
   - Rate at which air temperature decreases with altitude in the atmosphere.

2. **Adiabatic Lapse Rate**:
   - Rate of temperature change of a parcel of air as it moves up or down without exchanging heat.

3. **Atmospheric Stability**:
   - Stability determines whether air will rise, leading to cloud formation and precipitation.

4. **Temperature Inversion (Radiation Inversion)**:
   - Occurs when temperature increases with altitude, trapping pollutants near the ground.

### Atmospheric Dispersion
1. **Maximum Mixing Depth**:
   - Maximum height to which pollutants can mix in the atmosphere.

2. **Ventilation Coefficient**:
   - Product of mixing depth and average wind speed; indicates the atmosphere's ability to disperse pollutants.

3. **Effective Stack Height**:
   - Height at which pollutants are effectively dispersed from a stack.

4. **Smokestack Plumes**:
   - Types include looping, coning, fanning, lofting, and fumigation, depending on atmospheric conditions.

5. **Gaussian Plume Model**:
   - Mathematical model used to predict the dispersion of pollutants in the atmosphere.

### Air Pollutants
1. **Definitions**:
   - **Pollutants**: Harmful substances released into the air.
   - **Contaminants**: Substances that are present in the air but not necessarily harmful.

2. **Primary and Secondary Pollutants**:
   - **Primary Pollutants**: Directly emitted from sources (e.g., CO, NOx).
   - **Secondary Pollutants**: Formed by chemical reactions in the atmosphere (e.g., ozone, PAN).

3. **Emission Standards**:
   - Regulations to control the amount of pollutants released into the atmosphere.

4. **Criteria Pollutants**:
   - Common pollutants regulated by health-based standards (e.g., PM, SO2, NO2).

5. **Sources and Effects**:
   - **Suspended Particulate Matter**: Respiratory issues.
   - **Oxides of Carbon**: CO poisoning, global warming (CO2).
   - **Oxides of Nitrogen**: Respiratory issues, photochemical smog.
   - **Oxides of Sulfur**: Acid rain, respiratory issues.
   - **PAN (Peroxyacetyl Nitrate)**: Eye irritation, respiratory issues.

### Smog
1. **Photochemical Smog**:
   - Formed by sunlight-driven reactions between pollutants.
   
2. **London Smog**:
   - Result of coal burning, characterized by sulfur dioxide and particulate matter.

### Ozone Layer Depletion
1. **CFCs**:
   - Chlorofluorocarbons, major contributors to ozone layer destruction.

2. **Destruction of Ozone Layer**:
   - CFCs and other chemicals cause thinning of the ozone layer, increasing UV radiation reaching Earth.

3. **Impact of Other Greenhouse Gases**:
   - Gases like methane and nitrous oxide also contribute to ozone depletion.

4. **Effect of Ozone Modification**:
   - Increased UV exposure can lead to skin cancer, cataracts, and other health issues.

### Standards and Control Measures
1. **Air Quality Standards**:
   - **Industrial**: Regulations for emissions from industrial sources.
   - **Commercial**: Standards for commercial establishments.
   - **Residential**: Limits on pollutants for residential areas.

2. **Control Measures**:
   - **Electrostatic Precipitator (ESP)**: Removes particulate matter using electrical charges.
   - **Cyclone Separator**: Uses centrifugal force to remove particles.
   - **Bag House**: Filtration system for removing particulates.
   - **Catalytic Converter**: Reduces emissions from vehicles.
   - **Scrubber (Venturi)**: Uses liquid to remove pollutants from gas streams.
