### Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA)

**Definition:**  
A process that evaluates the environmental consequences of proposed projects or developments before the decision to move forward is made.

**Key Objectives:**
1. Predict environmental impacts at an early stage.
2. Find ways to reduce adverse impacts.
3. Shape projects to suit the local environment.
4. Present the predictions and options to decision-makers.

**Stages of EIA:**
1. **Screening:** Determining if a project requires a full EIA.
2. **Scoping:** Identifying which impacts are significant.
3. **Impact Analysis:** Predicting the nature and scale of potential impacts.
4. **Mitigation:** Proposing measures to prevent, reduce, or compensate for adverse impacts.
5. **Reporting:** Documenting the findings in an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS).
6. **Review:** Examining the EIS to ensure its adequacy and accuracy.
7. **Decision-making:** Approving or rejecting the project based on the EIS.
8. **Monitoring:** Ensuring that mitigation measures are implemented and effective.

**Benefits:**
- Protects the environment by preventing harmful projects.
- Promotes sustainable development.
- Involves public participation and transparency.
