### Hydrosphere, Hydrological Cycle, and Natural Water

**Hydrosphere:**
- Encompasses all water on Earth (oceans, lakes, rivers, groundwater, glaciers, and vapor).
- Essential for life, weather patterns, and climate.

**Hydrological Cycle:**
- Continuous movement of water on, above, and below Earth's surface.
- Key processes: Evaporation, Transpiration, Condensation, Precipitation, Infiltration, and Runoff.

**Natural Water:**
- Found in various forms: Surface water (rivers, lakes), Groundwater (aquifers), Atmospheric water (vapor).

### Pollutants of Water: Origin and Effects

1. **Oxygen-demanding Wastes:**
   - **Origin:** Sewage, agricultural runoff.
   - **Effects:** Decrease dissolved oxygen (DO), harm aquatic life.

2. **Pathogens:**
   - **Origin:** Sewage, animal waste.
   - **Effects:** Cause diseases (cholera, dysentery).

3. **Nutrients:**
   - **Origin:** Fertilizers, sewage.
   - **Effects:** Eutrophication, algal blooms.

4. **Salts:**
   - **Origin:** Agricultural runoff, industrial discharge.
   - **Effects:** Soil salinization, harm to aquatic life.

5. **Thermal Pollution:**
   - **Origin:** Industrial cooling processes.
   - **Effects:** Alters temperature, affects aquatic ecosystems.

6. **Heavy Metals:**
   - **Origin:** Industrial waste, mining.
   - **Effects:** Toxicity to humans and wildlife (bioaccumulation).

7. **Pesticides:**
   - **Origin:** Agricultural runoff.
   - **Effects:** Toxic to aquatic life, potential carcinogens.

8. **Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs):**
   - **Origin:** Industrial discharge, solvents.
   - **Effects:** Toxicity, cancer risk.

### River, Lake, and Ground Water Pollution

**River Pollution:**
- **DO (Dissolved Oxygen):** Indicates water quality.
- **5-day BOD (Biochemical Oxygen Demand) Test:** Measures oxygen consumption by microorganisms.
- **Seeded BOD Test:** Adds microorganisms to the sample.
- **BOD Reaction Rate Constants:** Reflects the rate of oxygen consumption.
- **Effect of Oxygen-demanding Wastes:** Leads to deoxygenation, reaeration.
- **COD (Chemical Oxygen Demand):** Measures total oxygen consumption for oxidation.
- **Oil and Greases:** Indicate pollution from hydrocarbons.
- **pH:** Indicates acidity/basicity, affects aquatic life.

**Lake Pollution:**
- **Eutrophication:** Excessive nutrients (N, P) cause algal blooms.
  - **Source:** Agricultural runoff, sewage.
  - **Effect:** Depleted oxygen, fish kills, harmful algal toxins.

**Ground Water Pollution:**
- **Aquifers:** Underground layers storing water.
- **Hydraulic Gradient:** Slope of the water table.
- **Ground Water Flow:** Movement of water through aquifers.

### Standards and Control

**Waste Water Standards:**
- **BOD:** Indicator of organic pollution.
- **COD:** Total oxygen requirement for oxidation.
- **Oil and Grease:** Limits to prevent hydrocarbon pollution.

**Water Treatment Systems:**
- **Coagulation and Flocculation:** Aggregation of particles.
- **Sedimentation and Filtration:** Removal of suspended solids.
- **Disinfection:** Kills pathogens (chlorination, UV).
- **Hardness and Alkalinity:** Removal of calcium, magnesium.
- **Softening:** Reduces hardness.

**Waste Water Treatment Systems:**
- **Primary Treatment:** Physical removal (screening, sedimentation).
- **Secondary Treatment:** Biological degradation (trickling filters, rotating biological contractors, activated sludge).
- **Sludge Treatment:** Stabilization and disposal.
- **Oxidation Ponds:** Biological treatment using ponds.
- **Tertiary Treatment:** Advanced treatment (polishing, nutrient removal).

### Water Pollution Due to Toxic Elements and Their Biochemical Effects

1. **Lead:**
   - **Effects:** Neurotoxicity, developmental issues in children.
  
2. **Mercury:**
   - **Effects:** Neurotoxicity, bioaccumulation in fish.
  
3. **Cadmium:**
   - **Effects:** Kidney damage, bone fragility.
  
4. **Arsenic:**
   - **Effects:** Carcinogenic, skin lesions.
