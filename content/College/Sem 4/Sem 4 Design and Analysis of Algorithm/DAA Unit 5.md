#### Approximation Algorithms

**Definition:**
Approximation algorithms are algorithms used for optimization problems where finding the exact solution is computationally hard (e.g., NP-hard problems). They provide solutions that are close to the optimal with a guarantee on the performance ratio.

**Key Concepts:**

- **Performance Ratio:** The ratio of the approximate solution's value to the optimal solution's value. For a minimization problem, it's defined as `max(C_approx/C_opt, C_opt/C_approx)` where `C_approx` is the cost of the approximate solution and `C_opt` is the cost of the optimal solution.
- **Polynomial-Time Approximation Scheme (PTAS):** An algorithm that takes an instance of an optimization problem and a parameter ε > 0, and produces a solution that is within a factor of `1 + ε` of the optimal solution in polynomial time for any fixed ε.
- **Fully Polynomial-Time Approximation Scheme (FPTAS):** A PTAS where the running time is polynomial in both the input size and 1/ε.

**Examples:**
- **Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP):** There are heuristic approaches like Christofides' algorithm for metric TSP which guarantees a solution within 1.5 times the optimal solution.
- **Knapsack Problem:** The greedy algorithm and dynamic programming approaches provide near-optimal solutions efficiently.

#### Randomized Algorithms

**Definition:**
Randomized algorithms use random numbers to influence their behavior, providing good expected performance or high probability of correctness.

**Key Concepts:**

- **Las Vegas Algorithms:** Always produce correct results, but their running time is a random variable (e.g., QuickSort).
- **Monte Carlo Algorithms:** Produce correct results with a certain probability, and have deterministic running time (e.g., randomized primality testing).
- **Probabilistic Analysis:** Involves analyzing the expected running time or the probability that the algorithm produces the correct result.

**Examples:**
- **QuickSort:** Randomly selects a pivot, providing expected O(n log n) time complexity.
- **Randomized Min-Cut Algorithm:** Used in network reliability, with a high probability of finding a minimum cut in polynomial time.

#### Complexity Classes Beyond NP

**P-Space (PSPACE):**
- **Definition:** The class of problems that can be solved by a Turing machine using a polynomial amount of space.
- **Key Characteristics:** Includes problems solvable in polynomial space, regardless of time. PSPACE contains NP, co-NP, and is itself contained in EXPTIME.
- **Examples:** 
  - **Quantified Boolean Formula (QBF):** A generalization of SAT where variables can be universally or existentially quantified.
  - **TQBF (True Quantified Boolean Formula):** A PSPACE-complete problem which involves determining if a fully quantified Boolean formula is true.

**EXP (Exponential Time):**
- **Definition:** The class of problems solvable by a deterministic Turing machine in exponential time (e.g., O(2^p(n)) for some polynomial p(n)).
- **Key Characteristics:** Contains all problems that can be solved in exponential time; PSPACE is a subset of EXP.
- **Examples:** 
  - Certain instances of the Generalized Chess Problem, where the solution might take an exponential amount of time relative to the board size.

**EXPSPACE (Exponential Space):**
- **Definition:** The class of problems solvable using exponential space.
- **Key Characteristics:** Problems in this class require a Turing machine to use a space of 2^(p(n)) for some polynomial p(n).
- **Examples:**
  - Certain games like Go or Chess, with large board sizes and many possible moves, can require exponential space for comprehensive solution exploration.

**Key Relationships:**
- **PSPACE ⊆ EXP:** All problems solvable in polynomial space can be solved in exponential time.
- **NP ⊆ PSPACE:** All problems solvable in nondeterministic polynomial time can be solved in polynomial space.
- **P ⊆ NP ⊆ PSPACE ⊆ EXP ⊆ EXPSPACE:** Reflecting the increasing resource requirements from polynomial time through exponential space.
