### Metabolism and Energy Transactions

#### Fundamental Principles of Energy Transactions
- **Energy Transactions**: In both physical and biological worlds, the laws of thermodynamics govern energy transactions.
- **First Law of Thermodynamics**: Energy cannot be created or destroyed, only transformed.
- **Second Law of Thermodynamics**: Every energy transfer increases the entropy (disorder) of the universe.

#### Thermodynamics in Biological Systems
- **Biological Thermodynamics**: Focuses on how energy transformations underpin biological processes.
- **Exothermic vs. Endothermic Reactions**:
  - **Exothermic**: Reactions that release heat (e.g., combustion).
  - **Endothermic**: Reactions that absorb heat (e.g., photosynthesis).
- **Exergonic vs. Endergonic Reactions**:
  - **Exergonic (ΔG < 0)**: Reactions that release free energy and are spontaneous.
  - **Endergonic (ΔG > 0)**: Reactions that absorb free energy and are non-spontaneous.

#### Key Concepts in Thermodynamics
- **Keq (Equilibrium Constant)**:
  - Defines the ratio of product concentrations to reactant concentrations at equilibrium.
  - Related to standard free energy change (ΔG°) by the equation: ΔG° = -RT ln(Keq).
- **Standard Free Energy (ΔG°)**:
  - The free energy change when reactants and products are in their standard states.
  - Determines the spontaneity of a reaction.
  - **Spontaneity**: If ΔG < 0, the reaction is spontaneous; if ΔG > 0, the reaction is non-spontaneous.

#### ATP as an Energy Currency
- **ATP (Adenosine Triphosphate)**:
  - Main energy currency in cells.
  - Hydrolysis of ATP to ADP + Pi releases energy that can be used by the cell.
  - Coupled reactions: ATP hydrolysis is often coupled with endergonic reactions to drive them.

#### Metabolic Pathways
- **Glycolysis**:
  - Breakdown of glucose to pyruvate, yielding 2 ATP and 2 NADH per glucose molecule.
  - Occurs in the cytoplasm.
  - Net reaction: C6H12O6 + 2 ADP + 2 Pi + 2 NAD+ → 2 C3H4O3 + 2 ATP + 2 NADH + 2 H2O.

- **Krebs Cycle (Citric Acid Cycle)**:
  - Oxidation of acetyl-CoA to CO2 and H2O, yielding ATP, NADH, and FADH2.
  - Occurs in the mitochondrial matrix.
  - Net reaction: Acetyl-CoA + 3 NAD+ + FAD + ADP + Pi + 2 H2O → 2 CO2 + 3 NADH + 3 H+ + FADH2 + ATP + CoA.

- **Photosynthesis**:
  - Conversion of CO2 and H2O into glucose and O2 using light energy.
  - Occurs in chloroplasts.
  - Involves light-dependent reactions (produce ATP and NADPH) and Calvin cycle (fixes CO2 into glucose).

#### Energy Yielding and Energy Consuming Reactions
- **Energy Yielding Reactions**:
  - Glycolysis, Krebs cycle, and oxidative phosphorylation release energy stored in ATP.
- **Energy Consuming Reactions**:
  - Biosynthetic processes (e.g., synthesis of glucose in photosynthesis) require energy input, usually from ATP.

#### Concept of Energy Charge
- **Energy Charge**: 
  - Ratio of available ATP to the total adenine nucleotide pool (ATP, ADP, AMP).
  - Regulates metabolic pathways: high energy charge inhibits energy-producing pathways and activates energy-consuming pathways.
  - Formula: $\text{Energy Charge} = \frac{[ATP] + 0.5[ADP]}{[ATP] + [ADP] + [AMP]}$.

### Summary
Understanding the principles of thermodynamics and energy transactions in biological systems is crucial for comprehending how organisms obtain, convert, and utilize energy. Key metabolic pathways like glycolysis, the Krebs cycle, and photosynthesis are central to these processes, with ATP serving as the primary energy currency. The equilibrium constant (Keq) and standard free energy (ΔG°) are fundamental concepts that determine reaction spontaneity, while the energy charge of a cell helps regulate its metabolic state.
