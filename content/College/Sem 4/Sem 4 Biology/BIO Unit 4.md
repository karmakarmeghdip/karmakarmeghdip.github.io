### Biomolecules: Building Blocks of Life

#### Introduction
- All forms of life share the same fundamental building blocks: biomolecules.
- Despite the commonality in the basic components, the diversity in life forms is immense.
- Biomolecules include monomeric units that assemble into complex polymeric structures.

### Monomeric Units and Polymeric Structures

1. **Monomeric Units**
   - Small molecules that serve as the basic building blocks for larger structures.
   - Examples: amino acids, nucleotides, monosaccharides, fatty acids.

2. **Polymeric Structures**
   - Large molecules formed by the polymerization of monomeric units.
   - Examples: proteins (from amino acids), nucleic acids (from nucleotides), polysaccharides (from monosaccharides), lipids (from fatty acids).

### Sugars, Starch, and Cellulose

1. **Sugars (Monosaccharides)**
   - Simplest form of carbohydrates (e.g., glucose, fructose).
   - Serve as energy sources and building blocks for more complex carbohydrates.

2. **Starch**
   - A polysaccharide composed of glucose monomers.
   - Primary energy storage in plants.
   - Made of two types of molecules: amylose (linear) and amylopectin (branched).

3. **Cellulose**
   - A polysaccharide composed of glucose monomers linked by β(1→4) glycosidic bonds.
   - Major component of plant cell walls.
   - Provides structural support due to its high tensile strength.

### Amino Acids and Proteins

1. **Amino Acids**
   - Organic molecules with an amino group (-NH2), a carboxyl group (-COOH), and a side chain (R group).
   - 20 standard amino acids in proteins.

2. **Proteins**
   - Polymers of amino acids linked by peptide bonds.
   - Function as enzymes, structural proteins, transport proteins, hormones, and antibodies.
   - Structure levels: primary (sequence), secondary (α-helices and β-sheets), tertiary (3D folding), quaternary (multiple polypeptides).

### Nucleotides and DNA/RNA

1. **Nucleotides**
   - Monomers consisting of a nitrogenous base, a pentose sugar, and one or more phosphate groups.
   - Types of bases: purines (adenine, guanine) and pyrimidines (cytosine, thymine in DNA; uracil in RNA).

2. **DNA (Deoxyribonucleic Acid)**
   - A double-stranded helix composed of nucleotide monomers.
   - Stores genetic information.
   - Bases: adenine (A), thymine (T), cytosine (C), guanine (G).
   - Base pairing: A-T and C-G.

3. **RNA (Ribonucleic Acid)**
   - Single-stranded nucleic acid.
   - Involved in protein synthesis and gene regulation.
   - Bases: adenine (A), uracil (U), cytosine (C), guanine (G).
   - Types: mRNA (messenger RNA), tRNA (transfer RNA), rRNA (ribosomal RNA).

### Two Carbon Units and Lipids

1. **Two Carbon Units (Acetyl Groups)**
   - Acetyl-CoA is a key molecule in metabolism, consisting of an acetyl group (CH3CO-) attached to coenzyme A.
   - Central to the synthesis and oxidation of fatty acids and the production of energy via the citric acid cycle.

2. **Lipids**
   - Diverse group of hydrophobic molecules, including fats, oils, phospholipids, and steroids.
   - Functions: energy storage, cell membrane structure, signaling.
   - Fatty acids: long hydrocarbon chains with a carboxyl group; can be saturated or unsaturated.
   - Triglycerides: formed from three fatty acids and glycerol; main form of stored energy in animals.
   - Phospholipids: composed of two fatty acids, a glycerol, and a phosphate group; essential for cell membrane structure.

### Summary
- The diversity of life stems from the varied combinations and structures of a few fundamental biomolecules.
- Monomers such as sugars, amino acids, nucleotides, and fatty acids are the building blocks.
- Polymers like polysaccharides, proteins, nucleic acids, and lipids perform complex biological functions essential for life.
