Context-free languages (CFLs) and pushdown automata (PDAs) form a foundational aspect of theoretical computer science, particularly in the study of formal languages and automata theory. Here's a detailed overview of the topics you mentioned:

### Context-Free Grammars (CFG) and Context-Free Languages (CFL)

**Context-Free Grammar (CFG)**:
- A CFG is a set of recursive rewriting rules (or productions) used to generate patterns of strings.
- A CFG is defined by $G = (V, \Sigma, R, S)$ where:
  - $V$ is a finite set of variables (non-terminal symbols).
  - $\Sigma$ is a finite set of terminal symbols.
  - $R$ is a finite set of production rules of the form $A \rightarrow \alpha$, where $A$ is a non-terminal and $\alpha$ is a string consisting of terminals and/or non-terminals.
  - $S$ is the start symbol.

**Context-Free Language (CFL)**:
- A language $L$ is called context-free if there exists a CFG $G$ such that $L = L(G)$, where $L(G)$ is the set of all strings derivable from the start symbol $S$.

### Chomsky and Greibach Normal Forms

**Chomsky Normal Form (CNF)**:
- A CFG is in Chomsky Normal Form if all its production rules are of the form:
  1. $A \rightarrow BC$ where $A, B, C$ are non-terminal symbols, and neither $B$ nor $C$ is the start symbol.
  2. $A \rightarrow a$ where $A$ is a non-terminal and $a$ is a terminal.
  3. $S \rightarrow \epsilon$ where $S$ is the start symbol and $\epsilon$ is the empty string.

**Greibach Normal Form (GNF)**:
- A CFG is in Greibach Normal Form if all its production rules are of the form:
  - $A \rightarrow a\alpha$, where $A$ is a non-terminal, $a$ is a terminal, and $\alpha$ is a (possibly empty) string of non-terminals.

### Pushdown Automata (PDA)

**Nondeterministic Pushdown Automata (NPDA)**:
- A PDA is an automaton equivalent to a CFG in terms of language recognition.
- An NPDA can be defined as $M = (Q, \Sigma, \Gamma, \delta, q_0, Z_0, F)$ where:
  - $Q$ is a finite set of states.
  - $\Sigma$ is a finite set of input symbols (alphabet).
  - $\Gamma$ is a finite set of stack symbols.
  - $\delta$ is the transition function: $\delta: Q \times (\Sigma \cup \{\epsilon\}) \times \Gamma \rightarrow \mathcal{P}(Q \times \Gamma^*)$.
  - $q_0$ is the start state.
  - $Z_0$ is the initial stack symbol.
  - $F$ is the set of accepting states.

### Equivalence of CFG and PDA

- Every context-free language can be generated by a CFG and recognized by a PDA.
- Conversely, every language recognized by a PDA can be generated by a CFG.

### Parse Trees

- A parse tree is a tree representation of the syntactic structure of a string according to some CFG.
- Each internal node corresponds to a non-terminal symbol and each leaf node corresponds to a terminal symbol.

### Ambiguity in CFG

- A CFG is ambiguous if there exists at least one string that can be generated by the grammar in more than one way (i.e., it has more than one distinct parse tree).

### Pumping Lemma for Context-Free Languages

- The pumping lemma for CFLs is used to prove that certain languages are not context-free.
- It states that for any context-free language $L$, there exists a number $p$ (the pumping length) such that any string $s \in L$ with $|s| \geq p$ can be decomposed into $s = uvwxy$ such that:
  1. $|vwx| \leq p$
  2. $vx \neq \epsilon$
  3. $u v^i w x^i y \in L$ for all $i \geq 0$

### Deterministic Pushdown Automata (DPDA)

- A DPDA is a PDA where for each state and input symbol (including $\epsilon$), there is at most one possible transition.
- DPDAs are less powerful than NPDAs, meaning there are some context-free languages that cannot be recognized by any DPDA.

### Closure Properties of CFLs

CFLs are closed under the following operations:
- Union
- Concatenation
- Kleene star
- Reversal

CFLs are not closed under:
- Intersection
- Complementation

Understanding these concepts is crucial for deep insights into formal language theory, which has applications in compiler design, parsing, and many areas of computer science.
