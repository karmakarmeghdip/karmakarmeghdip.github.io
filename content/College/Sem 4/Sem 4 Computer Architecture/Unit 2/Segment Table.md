Each process in a system typically has its own separate segment table. This organization ensures isolation and protection between processes, allowing each process to have its own view of memory. Here’s a more detailed explanation:

### Separate Segment Tables for Each Process

#### Concept of Segmentation

- **Segmentation**: Divides the memory into different segments such as code, data, stack, etc. Each segment is a contiguous block of addresses and represents a logical unit of the program.

#### Per-Process Segment Tables

- **Isolation and Protection**: Each process having its own segment table ensures that one process cannot directly access the memory of another process, enhancing security and stability. If a process tries to access a memory address not within its segments, a segmentation fault occurs.
- **Context Switching**: When the operating system switches from one process to another (context switching), it also switches the segment tables. This means the memory addresses used by one process do not interfere with those of another process.
- **Logical Address Space**: Each process sees a logical address space divided into segments (e.g., segment 0 for code, segment 1 for data, segment 2 for stack, etc.). These segments are mapped to physical memory independently for each process.

#### Structure of Segment Tables

- **Segment Descriptor**: Each entry in a segment table, called a segment descriptor, includes information such as the base address (starting physical address of the segment), limit (length of the segment), and access control bits (permissions).
- **Protection**: The segment descriptor can enforce access control, ensuring that segments can be read-only, read-write, or execute-only, depending on the segment type.

#### Benefits of Separate Segment Tables

- **Protection**: Prevents processes from interfering with each other’s memory, which is critical for system stability and security.
- **Flexibility**: Allows each process to have a different number and size of segments, tailored to its specific needs.
- **Modularity**: Supports the modular design of programs, where different modules (segments) can be independently managed and protected.

### Comparison with a Universal Segment Table

If there were a universal segment table for all processes:

- **Complexity**: The segment table would be much more complex, requiring additional mechanisms to differentiate between segments of different processes.
- **Security Risks**: A universal segment table could increase the risk of accidental or malicious memory access between processes.
- **Performance Issues**: The system would need to frequently update the segment table entries for each context switch, potentially leading to performance degradation.

### Summary

In summary, maintaining separate segment tables for each process is the standard approach in systems that use segmentation. This design ensures that each process has its own protected and isolated address space, enhancing security, stability, and flexibility. During context switches, the operating system updates the segment table pointer to point to the segment table of the currently executing process, maintaining the isolation between different processes' memory spaces.
