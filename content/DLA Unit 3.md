### Graph and Tree Algorithms: Traversal and Other Key Algorithms

#### 1. Traversal Algorithms

**Depth First Search (DFS)**
- **Description**: An algorithm for traversing or searching tree or graph data structures. It starts at the root (or an arbitrary node) and explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking.
- **Implementation**:
  - **Recursive**:
    ```python
    def DFS(graph, node, visited):
        if node not in visited:
            print(node)
            visited.add(node)
            for neighbor in graph[node]:
                DFS(graph, neighbor, visited)
    ```
  - **Iterative**:
    ```python
    def DFS(graph, start):
        visited, stack = set(), [start]
        while stack:
            vertex = stack.pop()
            if vertex not in visited:
                print(vertex)
                visited.add(vertex)
                stack.extend(set(graph[vertex]) - visited)
    ```
- **Applications**: Pathfinding, topological sorting, solving puzzles with only one solution (like mazes).

**Breadth First Search (BFS)**
- **Description**: An algorithm for traversing or searching tree or graph data structures. It starts at the tree root (or an arbitrary node) and explores the neighbor nodes at the present depth prior to moving on to nodes at the next depth level.
- **Implementation**:
  ```python
  def BFS(graph, start):
      visited, queue = set(), [start]
      while queue:
          vertex = queue.pop(0)
          if vertex not in visited:
              print(vertex)
              visited.add(vertex)
              queue.extend(set(graph[vertex]) - visited)
  ```
- **Applications**: Shortest path in unweighted graphs, peer-to-peer networks, social networking sites.

#### 2. Shortest Path Algorithms

**Dijkstra's Algorithm**
- **Description**: Finds the shortest path between nodes in a graph, which may represent, for example, road networks.
- **Implementation**:
  ```python
  import heapq

  def dijkstra(graph, start):
      heap = [(0, start)]
      distances = {node: float('infinity') for node in graph}
      distances[start] = 0
      while heap:
          current_distance, current_node = heapq.heappop(heap)
          if current_distance > distances[current_node]:
              continue
          for neighbor, weight in graph[current_node].items():
              distance = current_distance + weight
              if distance < distances[neighbor]:
                  distances[neighbor] = distance
                  heapq.heappush(heap, (distance, neighbor))
      return distances
  ```
- **Applications**: GPS systems, network routing protocols.

**Bellman-Ford Algorithm**
- **Description**: Computes shortest paths from a single source vertex to all of the other vertices in a weighted digraph. Can handle negative weights.
- **Implementation**:
  ```python
  def bellman_ford(graph, start):
      distance = {node: float('infinity') for node in graph}
      distance[start] = 0
      for _ in range(len(graph) - 1):
          for node in graph:
              for neighbor, weight in graph[node].items():
                  if distance[node] + weight < distance[neighbor]:
                      distance[neighbor] = distance[node] + weight
      # Check for negative weight cycles
      for node in graph:
          for neighbor, weight in graph[node].items():
              if distance[node] + weight < distance[neighbor]:
                  return "Graph contains negative weight cycle"
      return distance
  ```
- **Applications**: Economics (arbitrage), routing in communication networks.

**Floyd-Warshall Algorithm**
- **Description**: A dynamic programming algorithm to find shortest paths between all pairs of vertices.
- **Implementation**:
  ```python
  def floyd_warshall(graph):
      distance = dict(graph)
      for k in graph:
          for i in graph:
              for j in graph:
                  distance[i][j] = min(distance[i][j], distance[i][k] + distance[k][j])
      return distance
  ```
- **Applications**: All-pairs shortest path problems, network analysis.

#### 3. Transitive Closure

**Warshall's Algorithm**
- **Description**: Computes the transitive closure of a graph. It determines which vertices are reachable from each vertex.

      closure = {i: {j: False for j in graph} for i in graph}
      for i in graph:
          for j in graph[i]:
              closure[i][j] = True
      for k in graph:
          for i in graph:
              for j in graph:
                  closure[i][j] = closure[i][j] or (closure[i][k] and closure[k][j])
      return closure
  ```
- **Applications**: Database query optimization, reachability queries.

#### 4. Minimum Spanning Tree (MST)

**Kruskal's Algorithm**
- **Description**: An algorithm to find a minimum spanning tree for a connected weighted graph. This means it finds a subset of the edges that form a tree including every vertex, where the total weight of all the edges in the tree is minimized.
- **Implementation**:
  ```python
  def kruskal(graph):
      parent = {}
      def find(n):
          if parent[n] != n:
              parent[n] = find(parent[n])
          return parent[n]
      def union(n1, n2):
          root1 = find(n1)
          root2 = find(n2)
          if root1 != root2:
              parent[root2] = root1

      edges = sorted(graph['edges'], key=lambda edge: edge[2])
      mst = []
      for n in graph['nodes']:
          parent[n] = n
      for edge in edges:
          n1, n2, weight = edge
          if find(n1) != find(n2):
              union(n1, n2)
              mst.append(edge)
      return mst
  ```
- **Applications**: Network design, circuit design.

**Prim's Algorithm**

  def prim(graph, start):
      mst = []
      visited = set([start])
      edges = [(weight, start, to) for to, weight in graph[start].items()]
      heapq.heapify(edges)
      while edges:
          weight, frm, to = heapq.heappop(edges)
          if to not in visited:
              visited.add(to)
              mst.append((frm, to, weight))
              for to_next, weight in graph[to].items():
                  if to_next not in visited:
                      heapq.heappush(edges, (weight, to, to_next))
      return mst
  ```
- **Applications**: Similar to Kruskal's algorithm, used in network design.

#### 5. Topological Sorting

**Description**: A linear ordering of vertices in a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) such that for every directed edge `uv`, vertex `u` comes before `v` in the ordering.
- **Implementation**:

      visited = set()
      stack = []

      def dfs(node):
          if node not in visited:
              visited.add(node)
              for neighbor in graph[node]:
                  dfs(neighbor)
              stack.append(node)

      for node in graph:
          if node not in visited:

      visited = set([source])
      queue = [source]
      while queue:
          node = queue.pop(0)
          for neighbor, capacity in graph[node].items():
              if neighbor not in visited and capacity > 0:

  def ford_fulkerson(graph, source, sink):
      parent = {}
      max_flow = 0
      while bfs_capacity(graph, source, sink, parent):
          path_flow = float('inf')
          s = sink
          while s != source:
              path_flow = min(path_flow, graph[parent[s]][s])
              s = parent[s]

          v = sink
          while v != source:
              u = parent[v]
              graph[u][v] -= path_flow
